#Based on the skewness and kurtosis results, we can determine that the distribution of "y" does not conform to the assumption of a strict Poisson distribution. 
#Specifically, skewness values greater than 1 indicate that the data distribution is right-skewed, and kurtosis values greater than 3 indicate that the data distribution is sharper than the Poisson distribution.
#In such cases, a Negative Binomial Distribution (NBD) regression model may be considered, as it can be fitted when a Poisson regression model is not up to the task.
